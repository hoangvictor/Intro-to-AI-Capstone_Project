# Land Rover on Mars - Capstone Project - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

It's my capstone project about search algorithms that I've done with my team at university.

In this project, we have a grayscale topographic map of a part of Mars and some features of the land rover. Our mission is to help this land rover to find a path from one point to other point in this map. We've analysed also the difference between different types of algorithms, different heuristic functions for informed search, etc...

**Note:
- Execute only the file results_analysis.py in order to get the results for analysis.
- Execute the file visualzation.py to see the visualization of our algorithms (need to install pygame module first)
